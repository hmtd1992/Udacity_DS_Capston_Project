# Project Overview#

Welcome to the dog breed classifier project. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks.In this project, we learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If we supply an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
In this post,I have described my Jupyter Notebook which will guide us to make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog’s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

We break our task into following steps:
Step 0: Import Dataset


## Step 1: Detect Humans

## Step 2: Detect Dogs

## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

## Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

## Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

## Step 6: Write an Algorithm

## Step 7: Test an Algorithm
